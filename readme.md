<h2>Problem </h2>

Can natural disasters increase public awareness of climate change?
Is there any trend in natural disaster incidents and casualties from natural disasters over the years? 
How impactful is the media interest of climate change over the natural disaster incidents?

<h2> Motivation </h2>
Our primary motivation was to analyse the natural disasters to find if their occurrence or the deaths caused by them have stirred up any awareness about the climate change. Along the way, we have tried to draw important insights about the trends of natural disasters, and their impact on human lives.

<h2>Dataset</h2>

Natural Disaster incident over years ( https://www.kaggle.com/brsdincer/all-natural-disasters-19002021-eosdis). This dataset contains 2 csv files, with each containing 45 columns having information about year, disaster type, country, etc. 

Media (specifically TV news) interest in climate change over years: (https://blog.gdeltproject.org/a-new-dataset-for-exploring-climate-change-narratives-on-television-news-2009-2020/). This data contains 418 csv files, with each containing information about TV news reported on these natural disasters. 

Capital over gdp. This dataset contains columns and 19879 rows
