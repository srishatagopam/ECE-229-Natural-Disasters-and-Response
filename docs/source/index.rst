**ECE 229 - Natural Disasters and Response**
==================================================================

As a non-profit organization we want our end users/donators to understand the importance of
our work. Our goal is to convince English speaking potential donors to donate to our company
so we can continue our company’s mission: “help others through providing humanitarian aid.”
Through our dashboard we can educate potential donors on the magnitude of damage that
natural disasters can cause. Utilizing interactive visuals provide a digestible way to learn the
impact of natural disasters around the world such as the number of deaths, and monetary
damage.
